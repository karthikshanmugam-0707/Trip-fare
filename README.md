ðŸš— TripFare : Predicting Urban Taxi Fare with Machine Learning
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project predicts taxi trip fares based on trip details such as pickup/drop-off location, distance, time, and passenger count.
It uses Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Pickle for the machine learning model, and can be integrated with Streamlit for an interactive web app.

The aim is to demonstrate the full lifecycle of a machine learning project:

Data preprocessing & cleaning

Feature engineering

Model training

Saving and loading the model for predictions

Deployment-ready interface
